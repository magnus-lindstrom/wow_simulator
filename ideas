- struct with info about the fight needs to contain:
  - function that returns hit type
  - all buffs that need to be managed, like blade flurry, snd, proccs
    etc. Also contain swing timer, energy refill, global cd?
  - Extra attacks lined up

  - Weapon damage, swing timer, yellow damage
  - Enemy level
  - talents that affect damage output
  - ability to choose between poison and +dmg/crit on weapon
  - rotation to use
- Make a struct that can be any kind of procc on hit chance, like
  crusader, damage, dot, etc. Use an enum with values for each type of
  thing, that also tells how much dmg it does, for example. One enum
  value could be a struct maybe?
